# TLP

This tool can be used to lookup Italian translations of English words.

Simply run tlp.py, preferably from the command line; the help menu prints odd in the shell.


Future plans:

1)	Implement auto-suggestion
2)	Separate lookup functions for different parts of a sentence
3)	Decide output language on the fly
4)	Russian input helper
