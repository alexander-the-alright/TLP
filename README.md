# TLP

This tool can be used to lookup Italian translations of English words.

Simply run tlp.py, preferably from the command line; the help menu prints odd in the shell.


Future plans:

1)	Implement a 'Did you mean XYZ?' method
2)	Clone script for Russian
	a)	Switch between the two languages during runtime
	b)	I <--> R translation ==> I <- [ -> E <- ] -> R
3)	Add/remove words during runtime
4)	Separate lookup functions for different parts of a sentence
	a)	vPrint
	b)	Help to accentuate the context of specific uses of words
